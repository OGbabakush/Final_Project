## Description
I will create a classic arcade-style Snake game created using Python and Pygame. 
It relates to media and digital arts because of the game design principles, user interaction, and the creative customization with sound, color, and animations.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The snake moves in a grid-based environment and grows when it eats food; controlled by keyboard input.
- Feature 2
	- The game detects collisions with walls or the snake’s own body and ends the game when a collision happens.
- Feature 3
	- Real-time score is shown on-screen using digital text rendering with Pygame’s font system.

## Challenges
- Learning how to use Pygame's drawing and event handling system.
- Understanding grid-based movement and collision logic.
- Learning how to use keyboard inputs in code.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A functional Snake game with visuals, real-time score, sound effects, and MAYBE multiple levels or difficulty scaling.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A basic working Snake game where the snake can move, eat food, grow, and end the game on collision, with score tracking.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up Pygame environment and draw the game window.
  2. Implement snake movement and controls.

- Week 2
  1. Add food generation and collision detection.
  2. Display score and implement game over logic.

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Polish visuals and colors, add optional sound effects.
  2. Test and finalize game for presentation.
